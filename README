This is a flash-tool to help upload images to webservers
often the image size if way beyond what the server can receive,
or the size is so big that it will take a long time to transfere
therefore this upload-tool will also resize the image.
When it has been resized it can be uploaded to the remote server.

The tool is built for adobe flash using HAXE and Windmill.

Enjoy!
